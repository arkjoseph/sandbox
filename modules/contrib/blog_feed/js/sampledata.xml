            <title>Royalty Free Tracks</title>
            <description>Sound effects are an important part of entertainment, often comprising an integral part of vidoes, games, podcasts, movies, and animations. However, the costs and conditions associated with acquiring and using sound effects may be prohibitive for many rising creators of media. Thankfully, royalty free tracks offer an alternative to media producers on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Royalty free sound effect tracks can be used by anyone. Not only are they legal to use, but in most cases they may be edited, looped, or manipulated by overlaying additional tracks to create another sound.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Video Optimization - Part 2</title>
            <description>Optimizing your video for search engines will increase the exposure that the video receives, and optimization will also help spread the video&apos;s message. Follow these steps to enhance your videos and improve their rankings... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Shorter Videos Rank Better&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No big surprise here -- the file size of short videos is much smaller than that of longer videos. On the video networks like YouTube, short videos are viewed far more often than longer ones. A length of less than 3 minutes per video seems to be ideal, and absolutely make every effort to keep your video under 10 minutes! If you have a long video segment, consider breaking it into multiple videos. The more popular videos on the video networks are given more exposure, which will also help increase the number of views received.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>While many have resisted the urge to decipher the meaning behind the acronym RSS, the vast majority of technically knowledgeable online surfers have begun incorporating RSS into their daily routines. Why go through the hassle of understanding something new, the novice might want to know? Because it saves time, and time is a precious commodity these days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The contents of an RSS feed can be read any number of ways. A variety of tools, both fee based and free, to read RSS feeds are available on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When determining what RSS feed reader to download, thought should be given to security. More an more publishers are using RSS feeds as a way to deliver podcasts or media rich-content.

            <title>RSS Feeds to Locate Jobs</title>
            <description>In addition to actually seeking a job, there are also other valid reasons to monitor the job market. Perhaps you are satisfied in your current position, but just want to keep an eye on new positions in a specific sector. Perhaps you are just curious to know what the wages are for similar positions. The job market can be monitored quite easily using RSS feeds. You can subscribe to RSS feeds in order to find specific company job openings, employment available within a specific region (i.e. by using a postal or zipcode), specific positions available, or to locate all jobs within a specific wage range.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Independent Artists and Musicians Should Podcast</title>
            <description>Independent artists have long struggled to gain recognition and attract an audience. Without the backing of a major label it can be very difficult for independent artists to obtain radio play time, that is, until now. Podcasting a revolutionary new medium, has opened new distribution channels for independent artists. Podcasting is the process of distributing audio files using the RSS format and has become very popular with the younger generations. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the use of technology, independent artists have a unique opportunity available, using technology they can significantly expand the exposure of their music.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Questioning Online Credibility</title>
            <description>Credibility online is becoming more and more of an issue. Anyone can have a blog or post to a forum and anyone can edit wiki entries. Web surfers are beginning to comprehend that just because it is in print does not necessarily mean that it is true. In fact, in today&apos;s online world, the collective truth might be the closest thing we can get to the real truth. Peer policing and social bookmarking have become common in the online world. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Human nature invariably prompts a level of trust;if it is written, it must be true. We live in a generation where we expect authors, editors and publishers that are qualified to write on various topics. What qualifications are required to post a blog, write an online article, or edit a wiki? Some web surfers may find the answer startling: None. Expertise is no longer a prerequisite. Wikipedia is a popular online reference, that frequently obtains top ranking in search engines as a reference source. How many Wikipedia readers realize that Wikipedia can be edited by anyone at anytime, regardless of their qualifications. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Effective Podcast Tips</title>
            <description>Many people assume that podcasting is all about audio and fail to acknowledge the writing behind the show. Skilled communicators understand the type of planning required in order to pull off a clean final product. The most memorable and effective podcasts are always well planned. Some of the best podcast shows use a script and follow a structured format. The preparation that occurs behind the scenes is similar to what would take place for a radio show. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Females, in particular, should be cautious when circumnavigating the blogosphere. If you are a blogger or contemplating an online journal, consider these tips to protecting your identity: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS2HTML Pro</title>
            <description>The RSS2HTML Pro add on script expands the functionality of RSS2HTML by allowing publishers and webmasters to dynamically create an index of feed items. The RSS2HTML Pro script dynamically generates a separate web page for each item contained in the RSS feed. The script also creates an index of feed items as a separate web page. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As with the RSS2HTML script the web pages dynamically update as the feed&apos;s item changes, meaning that the information displayed is always current. Additionally the contents of the web pages is able to be spidered by search engines. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Converting RSS to HTML</title>
            <description>Many webmasters have realized the benefit of using RSS to dynamically update websites. This means that the website content automatically changes when the RSS feed is updated. This allows for webmasters to serve dynamic content or a mixture of static and dynamic content on their website. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Syndication &lt;br /&gt;
Often, publishers, interested in expanding their base, will allow other webmasters to republish the contents of an RSS feed. Content providers that allow for syndication, receive additional exposure, and the webmasters serving the content, will generally see web traffic increase as a result of the new content. RSS feeds can be syndicated or displayed using a variety of different methods. Depending on the web host, server configuration, and the intent of the publishers, a variety of different syndication tools exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In most cases, providers convert RSS feeds to HTML in order to display the feeds contents. The following are some of the more popular methods to convert RSS feeds as web based content. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Podcasting Works</title>
            <description>Podcasting is RSS that is used to syndicate and distribute audio files. Podcasting contains an audio file in the RSS feed&apos;s enclosure tag. An enclosure tag is used in RSS feeds to include certain types of files. The file contained in an enclosure tag can be: an image, a data file, a video file, or an audio file. Podcasting specifically refers to RSS feeds that contain audio files in their enclosure tag. The RSS version that currently supports enclosure tags is RSS version 2.0. All podcasts are currently created using this specification.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips for Blogs</title>
            <description>Tips for creating a blog.&lt;br /&gt;
There are no hard and fast rules on how to blog. Having said that, bloggers will likely increase their exposure by following some simple blog guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1.) Stay on topic.&lt;br /&gt;
Opinions are generally accepted but the content of the items in the blog should all relate to a general theme. Unless you have an uncanny knack for wit, humor or cynicism, the majority of your readers will be interested in the content that relates to a specific defined theme or loosely defined area of interest. Most readers won&apos;t care that you eat Cheerios for breakfast. They may, however, be interested in the fact that vinegar takes out stains and that toilet paper rolls make great wreaths. Define a topic and stick to it. This will ensure that you create a loyal following of interested readers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasting Sermons</title>
            <description>Create Podcast Sermons &lt;br /&gt;
The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances. Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders that communities have become accustom to. Using technology as a communication medium has not been lost on spiritual leaders and many have embraced the Internet as a medium to spread their faith. It is rare to find a house of worship that does not have a website or Internet presense. Expanding upon this theme, parishes looked to podcasting to further expanded the reach of their spiritual counselors and ministers. Many preachers record homilies, hymns, services, sermons or gospel teachings, for parishioners and interested listeners.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Podcast Tips To A Great Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Podcast production takes effort, but anything worth doing is worth doing right. Use these tips to help produce a quality podcast that will be distinguished above other related podcasts... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog Tips for SEO</title>
            <description>Blogs are the current rage, and many webmasters have blogs but fail to use their blog to it&apos;s full potential. Blogs provide a steady stream of fresh content, and if this content is written and managed properly, blogs have the ability to increase a website&apos;s ranking in the search engines. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Host Your Own Blog &lt;br /&gt;
In order to prosper from a blog, be sure to host it on your own domain. Hosting the blog on your own server will maximize the links to your website. Link popularity is one of the factors search engines use to rank websites. Resist the urge to use free hosting services, do not give away your link popularity!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Do I Promote My Podcast?</title>
            <description>There are a variety of things you can do to promote your podcast and increase its popularity... &lt;br /&gt;
1. Auto-Discovery&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Include auto-discovery tags in the HTML header of the web page. Some podcasting and RSS readers will automatically detect that an RSS feed or podcast is available if such auto-discovery tags are included in the web page header tags.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS More Than Just News Headlines</title>
            <description>The core use for RSS is generally considered news headlines and blog syndication, but innovative businesses are learning to use RSS in different ways. Consider RSS as a communication channel that can provide current, targeted information as it appears within a very targeted audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Monitoring Newsgroups/Usenet &lt;br /&gt;
Google Groups is a free online community and discussion group service that offers the Web&apos;s most comprehensive archive of Usenet postings. Google Groups can be monitored using RSS feeds. In order to monitor a specific newsgroup simply add &quot;/feed/msgs.xml&quot; to the end of the Google Group URL. Add the new URL to a newsgroup reader and receive updates each time a new post is added to the newsgroup. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Tips for Helping Your RSS Feed Perform!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasting Content</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Podcasting content comes in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Businesses are finding many different and creative ways of incorporating podcasts into their business strategies and marketing plans. <br />
<br />
Here are just some of the various types of content that businesses are turning into podcasts... <br />
<br />
1. Audio Books<br />
<br />
Books that are "read" aloud are no longer embraced only by the visually impaired. For example, commuters who want to make the most of their travel time have long embraced books-on-tape. The podcast medium is far more compact and portable, so audio books and similar content are now being made available as podcasts. <br />
<br />
2. Audio Tours<br />
<br />
Interested in a guided tour of a historic site, or a detailed explanation of a museum display? Audio tour podcasts with detailed explanations are becoming quite common. <br />

            <title>Understanding RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS Feeds&lt;br /&gt;
RSS also known as rich site summary or real simply syndication, arrived on the scene a number of years ago, but was only recently embraced by webmasters as a means to effectively syndicate content. RSS Feeds provide webmasters and content providers an avenue to provide concise summaries to prospective readers. Thousands of commercial web sites and blogs now publish content summaries in an RSS feed. Each item in the feed typically contains a headline; article summary and link back to the online article.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Benefit to the Webmaster &lt;br /&gt;
As the web has become more crowded webmasters have been striving to provide fresh and up to date content for their website visitors. Many webmasters have discovered they can easily utilize the information in RSS feeds to provide fresh web content.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Personal Namespace Extension</title>
            <description>The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements (tags) in any RSS feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adding elements (tags) would typically only be used in an in-house solution where the writing application and the reading application have prior knowledge of the new tags. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Free RSS to HTML Tool</title>
            <description>In addition to making your RSS feed available to your visitors for use with their RSS Feed Reader, as a webmaster you may also want to make the same feed available on your website for viewing with a regular web browser. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several ways to do this, some have advantages or disadvantages compared to others. The best solution is one where the webpage is automatically updated on-the-fly, is easily spidered by search engine robots, and easy to implement. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Publicize Your RSS Feed</title>
            <description>Publicize your RSS feed. &lt;br /&gt;
There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you&apos;ve made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Submit Your RSS Feed to RSS Directories. &lt;br /&gt;
This will not only increase the number of sites linking to your website and increasing your link popularity, it will also increase the RSS feeds profile. A number of RSS search engines and RSS directories exist that allow you to freely submit RSS feeds.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Females, in particular, should be cautious when circumnavigating the blogosphere. If you are a blogger or contemplating an online journal, consider these tips to protecting your identity: &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Sound effects are an important part of entertainment, often comprising an integral part of vidoes, games, podcasts, movies, and animations. However, the costs and conditions associated with acquiring and using sound effects may be prohibitive for many rising creators of media. Thankfully, royalty free tracks offer an alternative to media producers on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;

Royalty free sound effect tracks can be used by anyone. Not only are they legal to use, but in most cases they may be edited, looped, or manipulated by overlaying additional tracks to create another sound.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>As the Internet matures, users and governments are struggling to manage controversial issues. Lets face it, the Internet did not exist when the US copyright laws were written;let us not forget, while many countries respect copyright laws, the Internet is global without a governing body.

            <title>Tips to Promoting Podcasts</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Podcast Promotion<br />
Podcasting is a great new medium, but creating a podcast is only half of the work. Promoting a podcast is equally critical to it's success. <br />
<b></b><br />
<b>1. Educate the Public.</b><br />
It is important to remember that podcasting is a relatively new technology and not everyone understands or knows what podcasting is. It is particularly important to educate users if your audience is not technical. Not only is it important to explain what a podcast is, but it is equally important to explain how your podcast will help listeners. Instruction on how users can listen to podcasts should also be included.<br />

            <title>How Podcasting Works</title>
            <description>It has been said that in October of 2004 a Google search returned less than 6,000 results for the term &lt;i&gt;podcasting&lt;/i&gt;. Today, a similar search yields more than 857,000 results. Like the blogging phenomenon, podcasting has come out of nowhere and attracted an enthusiastic following.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While some traditional radio talk shows have begun providing podcasts of their regularly-scheduled broadcasts, the bulk of the podcasts that have cropped up tend to be independent broadcasters who have a fascination with technology. As a result, some podcasts are a little rough around the edges. Nonetheless, it is clear that the technology provides a significant opportunity and potential. Even nay-sayers believe that podcasting is more than a passing fad.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling. Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows. They are often synchronized with certain actions, such as a door&apos;s slamming being accompanied by the appropriate noise. Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other emotions.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Website design can be elusive to even creative individuals. Sadly some webmasters do not realize their incompetence and they post websites that have grainy graphics and turgid colors. If you are one of these webmasters and have seen the error of your ways, consider this. Your website is a sales tool. A professional layout and design can significantly increase sales and conversion rates, gaining you customers. Businesses can greatly benefit from a professional and unforgettable logo that sets them apart from their competition. Logos are not just fancy graphics that adorn websites or letterhead, logos are a representation of a businesses&apos; philosophy. Logos are a critical component of brand development.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers of Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims.

&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog Tips for SEO</title>
            <description>Blogs are the current rage, and many webmasters have blogs but fail to use their blog to it&apos;s full potential. Blogs provide a steady stream of fresh content, and if this content is written and managed properly, blogs have the ability to increase a website&apos;s ranking in the search engines. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Host Your Own Blog &lt;br /&gt;
In order to prosper from a blog, be sure to host it on your own domain. Hosting the blog on your own server will maximize the links to your website. Link popularity is one of the factors search engines use to rank websites. Resist the urge to use free hosting services, do not give away your link popularity!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcast Audio Recording Tips</title>
            <description>Before you begin podcasting develop a plan and a format for your show. Determine the focus of your podcast and what types of guests you would like to interview. Time spent planning your show will contribute to it&apos;s success.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Location, Location, Location &lt;br /&gt;
When you are producing a podcast on a regular basis it is important that you select an appropriate location for the recording to take place. The location should be free of external distractions and relatively quiet. It is easiest if you use the same location each time, that way the equipment can remain in place and will not require moving or setup each time you produce a show.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Tips for Blogs</title>
            <description>Tips for creating a blog.&lt;br /&gt;
There are no hard and fast rules on how to blog. Having said that, bloggers will likely increase their exposure by following some simple blog guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1.) Stay on topic.&lt;br /&gt;
Opinions are generally accepted but the content of the items in the blog should all relate to a general theme. Unless you have an uncanny knack for wit, humor or cynicism, the majority of your readers will be interested in the content that relates to a specific defined theme or loosely defined area of interest. Most readers won&apos;t care that you eat Cheerios for breakfast. They may, however, be interested in the fact that vinegar takes out stains and that toilet paper rolls make great wreaths. Define a topic and stick to it. This will ensure that you create a loyal following of interested readers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What Can be Published Using RSS Feeds?</title>
            <description>With all the vast amounts of information available on the web, it is becoming more and more difficult to sort through and find what you are looking for. RSS significantly lowers the signal-to-noise ratio. RSS has the unique ability to compile information and filter it, so you only see unique and relevant content. The information superhighway has become packed with content, and those familiar with technology are using RSS to filter the content, allowing them to drill down and access only the content they want, without having to wade through all the noise. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>&lt;br /&gt;
1. Plan Accordingly. &lt;br /&gt;
When making the decision and commitment to podcast, it is important to think beyond the moment. Before starting, think about the time the podcast production will take. How will podcasting fit into a current schedule? How frequently will you podcast?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Advertising in RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>As publishers have moved towards monetizing RSS feeds, their have been vibrant discussions as to whether advertisements in feeds are viable or whether they will drive subscribers away. At the end of the day while it appears that many are discussing the philosophical approaches to ads in RSS feeds few are taking the time to examine the options available for inserting advertisements in feeds. Ultimately the advertisements served are going to determine the success of RSS as an advertising medium. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Innovation</title>
            <description>RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, is a new way to broadcast corporate news and structured information. RSS offers a quick, easy corporate communication channel. The RSS contents are published as a feed and the feed&apos;s content keep customers, partners and journalists abreast of corporate news and information. The RSS feeds are read using a tool referred to as a news aggregator, or an RSS reader. The aggregator periodically checks to see if the RSS feed has been updated. As the feed is updated, new information will automatically appear in the RSS reader. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Security</title>
            <description>RSS is growing at a lightening speed. What was once only known as a &lt;i&gt;techie tool,&lt;/i&gt; RSS is becoming a tool that is continuously being used by the general population. Along with the good comes, the not so good. And while some have mentioned the emergence of RSS spam, where content publishers dynamically generate nonsensical feeds stuffed with keywords, the real concern relates to security. While an annoyance to the search engines, spam in RSS feeds pales in comparison to the possible security concerns that could be in RSS future. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Content Syndication</title>
            <description>It is All About Content Syndication&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Creating Content&lt;br /&gt;
New websites are being launched daily. In order to compete, webmasters need to find alternative ways of producing themed websites. Highly focused articles are often sought by wembasters. Why? Because content on the web is still king! In order to attract search engines and site visitors, webmasters rely heavily on providing new, innovative and fresh content. If the web site content is rich, visitors will come. If the website content is updated regularly, visitors will return. When evaluating a website&apos;s traffic it is easy to see that the low cost of syndicated content can increase a website&apos;s value. Sites that contain multiple pages related to a specific topic increase the likelihood of being &apos;found&apos; when a variety of search phrases are used for that topic.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Publicize Your RSS Feed</title>
            <description>There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you&apos;ve made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
1. Submit Your RSS Feed to RSS Directories. &lt;br /&gt;
This will not only increase the number of sites linking to your website and increasing your link popularity, it will also increase the RSS feeds profile. A number of RSS search engines and RSS directories exist that allow you to freely submit RSS feeds. Feeds are generally categorized and grouped together by subject. Web surfers looking for RSS feeds about a specific subject will often search the RSS directories, to locate a feed that matches their specific criteria. Topic specific RSS feed and podcasting directories are also emerging. Choose a web feed&apos;s category carefully and only submit relevant feeds to topic specific directories.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS2HTML Script</title>
            <description>In addition to making your RSS feed available to your visitors for use with their RSS Feed Reader, as a webmaster you may also want to make the same feed available on your website for viewing with a regular web browser. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several ways to do this, some have advantages or disadvantages compared to others. The best solution is one where the webpage is automatically updated on-the-fly, is easily spidered by search engine robots, and easy to implement. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To attain this optimal solution, the developers of FeedForAll have created a free RSS to HTML PHP script, aptly named RSS2HTML. When used, this script will allow you to create webpages that will always display the most current information from your RSS feed, and because the resulting page is pure HTML, it will be in a format friendly to search engine robots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Re-Using Content</title>
            <description>Repurposing content is not a terribly new concept. Webmasters that picked up on the trend have benefited from traffic surges for a while now. Repurposing content is all about presenting the same content in a variety of different ways, or using different mediums to present the same content. Webmasters can manipulate content in order to provide the same content in any number of different formats. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why would publishers want to do this? There are a number of benefits to repurposing content, not the least of which is that it allows customers to select the format they wish to access your information. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Hallmarks of a Good Podcast</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[There are many, many things that separate a good podcast from all the rest. Here are a few to consider... <br />
Recording Quality<br />
<br />
The quality of the recording is probably the most critical component of a podcast. A good podcast is easy to understand, and should be recorded at a volume level that makes it easy for listeners to hear all that is said.<br />
<br />
<b>Sound Balance</b><br />
<br />
Adding background music polishes a podcast, but be careful that the music does not overpower the primary content. The background music should be subtle and not distracting. Create a balance that does not compromise the quality of the recording. Also, be sure that the music is not the focal point of a podcast show, unless the topic is about the music -- the emphasis should be on the primary content, and not on the musical arrangements.<br />

            <title>Why Niche RSS Feeds Matter</title>
            <description>Just as the second generation of search engines and directories evolved into niche topic specific portals we are seeing the same occur in the area of RSS feed directories and search engines. While some directories are admittedly more niche than others the trend is obvious. &lt;br /&gt;
Financial Industry&lt;br /&gt;
If you are in the finance industry you can monitor currency exchange rates, bank rates and track investments using RSS feeds. Financial institutions have found RSS to be an optimum way to communicate CD rates, interest rates, currency conversions, and even investors are using to monitor stocks. Use RSS to track currency conversions, stocks, bonds, bank rates and other financial related information.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>
                <![CDATA[The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their inspiration originated for their content. <br />
<br />
Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: <br />
<br />
<b>1.Google News </b><br />
Monitor Google News for keywords related to your industry. If you find a story you disagree with or wholeheartedly agree with write about it. Add your thoughts, and editorialize the content. This does not mean you should just repost Google news summaries. The value is not only in the news aggregation, but in the commentary that you provide. Tie news items to specific events, conditions, or the impact of specific news on the industry. Adding a view point or reference to a news article adds genuine value. <br />

            <description>Optimize your audio files to increase their popularity, just as you would optimize a website. Audio search engines are becoming more advanced as audio files become more commonplace on the Internet. Here are some tips to optimize your audio offerings... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Optimize Landing Page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Create a landing page for the audio files. The landing page should explain the audio content and encourage subscriptions. Outline the steps the visitor should take in order to subscribe or listen to the audio file. Make an effort to interact with the visitor on the landing page, and make it as easy as possible for them to subscribe or listen to your podcast. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Instant Content; Converting a Text Article to a Podcast&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are taught to recycle paper, cans, bottles and plastic but marketers rarely discuss the value of repackaging and repurposing content. Publishers and marketers alike have embraced content syndication and RSS but few have considered the value beyond the actual syndication. Consider an alternative communication channel that reaches a new or different audience. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Repurposing and repackaging content or information so that it can be consumed through a variety of mediums is not a new concept. Many businesses today sight increased communication as a common goal. Cost conscious businesses with tight budges are often interested in minimizing work loads and cost, while increasing communication. By presenting the same information in different ways and formats, businesses are able to increase the reach and communication, while remaining cost conscious. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Converting RSS Feeds to HTML</title>
            <description>Many webmasters have realized the benefit of using RSS to dynamically update websites. This means that the website content automatically changes when the RSS feed is updated. This allows for webmasters to serve dynamic content or a mixture of static and dynamic content on their website. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Etiquette for RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>The arguments continue to rage over the ambiguities in the RSS specifications. But the fact is: RSS is here to stay, and the current defined RSS 2.0 specification is likely going to be as good as it is going to get. Attempts have been made to create &quot;best practice&quot; documents and specification clarifications. We felt it would be helpful to provide general guidelines for those constructing an RSS 2.0 feed. In general, the following are guidelines for constructing an RSS feed. It is good to get into the habit of validating the RSS feed, either with software, or with an online validator. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Get Ideas for RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>How do you get ideas for blog posts and RSS feed posts?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>FutureRSS</title>
            <description>The future-rss.php script is used to automatically delay the publication of Items in an RSS feed. This allows Items in a RSS feed to be created ahead of time, and then slowly released over a period of time. Many people have tried to set the PubDate field on their RSS feed Items to a future date and time, in an attempt to have that particular item become &apos;visible to their feeds subscribers on that particular date and time. Unfortunately, they will soon find out that many RSS readers and aggregators don&apos;t honor future PubDates, and immediately show all their feed&apos;s items. The future-rss.php script &apos;hides&apos; the future items from RSS feed readers and aggregators, until their PubDate becomes current. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Increase Your RSS Feed Subscribers</title>
            <description>Growing subscribers of your RSS feed will expand your reach. Put the appropriate effort into marketing your RSS feed, so you can increase adoption and spread the message contained in the RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;
Feed Validation&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure that the feed is properly formed. Some RSS readers and aggregators will be unable to compensate or read an RSS feed that is not correctly formed. There are both web-based and desktop feed validation tools available that can help determine whether an RSS feed is properly formatted or not. After you edit the feed, be sure to spend a few minutes validating the feed. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog Tips for SEO</title>
            <description>Blogs are the current rage, and many webmasters have blogs but fail to use their blog to it&apos;s full potential. Blogs provide a steady stream of fresh content, and if this content is written and managed properly, blogs have the ability to increase a website&apos;s ranking in the search engines. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Host Your Own Blog &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In order to prosper from a blog, be sure to host it on your own domain. Hosting the blog on your own server will maximize the links to your website. Link popularity is one of the factors search engines use to rank websites. Resist the urge to use free hosting services, do not give away your link popularity!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feeds to Locate Jobs</title>
            <description>Using RSS Feeds To Locate Jobs&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to actually seeking a job, there are also other valid reasons to monitor the job market. Perhaps you are satisfied in your current position, but just want to keep an eye on new positions in a specific sector. Perhaps you are just curious to know what the wages are for similar positions. The job market can be monitored quite easily using RSS feeds.

            <title>What is Fair Use?</title>
            <description>As the Internet matures, users and governments are struggling to manage controversial issues. Lets face it, the Internet did not exist when the US copyright laws were written;let us not forget, while many countries respect copyright laws, the Internet is global without a governing body. There are not only different laws, rules and regulations, but also jurisdiction issues. RSS did not exist when copyright laws were written either. While ardent supporters feel any content in a feed can be syndicated, other equally fervent publishers contend that original works are just that--original works, and in many countries protected by copyright laws. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Realtors Estate and RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Why Should Realtors Use RSS?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is little argument that RSS can and will generate web traffic. Realtors using RSS feeds will increase the traffic to their website, and more web traffic means more potential buyers. RSS feeds will expand a realtor&apos;s reach and distribution, meaning that Realtors will reach new audiences using RSS feeds. RSS reaches areas through syndication that are just not as accessible through normal channels or traditional realty advertising. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Instant Content; Converting a Text Article to a Podcast&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are taught to recycle paper, cans, bottles and plastic but marketers rarely discuss the value of repackaging and repurposing content. Publishers and marketers alike have embraced content syndication and RSS but few have considered the value beyond the actual syndication. Consider an alternative communication channel that reaches a new or different audience. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Repurposing and repackaging content or information so that it can be consumed through a variety of mediums is not a new concept. Many businesses today sight increased communication as a common goal. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Get Ideas for RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Quick Questions About Podcasting</title>
            <description>Podcasting is an up-and-coming and increasingly popular medium for communication. The following are common questions about podcasting, perfect for those just getting started in podcasting as a communication channel...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What Format Should I Record To? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While other formats are supported, MP3 is by far the most common format used for audio podcasts. Unless there is a specific and compelling reason to use a different format, you should stick with MP3 files for audio podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasts and Copyrights</title>
            <description>Podcasting has a very low barrier to entry; all you need is audio recording software and a means of creating an RSS feed, be it through software or manual work. As a result, just about anyone can podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can&apos;t even be heard clearly. For this reason, copyright infringement leeches, often unwittingly, into a number of podcasts. To produce a successful podcast, it is important to understand and respect Western copyright laws. To help ensure that these things are done, we have compiled some information about podcasts, music, and copyright law. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Publicize your RSS feed. &lt;br /&gt;
There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you&apos;ve made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Submit Your RSS Feed to RSS Directories. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This will not only increase the number of sites linking to your website and increasing your link popularity, it will also increase the RSS feeds profile&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What Exactly is Podcasting?</title>
            <description>The term &lt;i&gt;podcast&lt;/i&gt; was initially used to reference an RSS feed that contained audio files in the items enclosure field. The meaning of podcasting has since expanded, and now refers to RSS feeds that contain all types of media, including audio and video, in the item&apos;s enclosure field. For the non-technical folks, podcasting is simply a means of syndicating and distributing rich-media files via the Internet. The content contained in a podcast can vary significantly, from a song, to a educational lecture, to a political debate, to just about anything else. One great thing about podcasting is the wide variety of content formats it can contain. And unlike radio or television broadcasts, the recipient can listen or view at their leisure, choosing for themselves when and where they wish to listen or view a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Influence of Technology on Politics</title>
            <description>Can, and will, the next generation of politicians exploit the communication mediums available to them? Will the new communication mediums have the power to influence public opinion? Will politicians be the victims of technology, or will they use it to their benefit? Will one party benefit from the use of the technology more than another? All reasonable questions, considering the role technology plays in today&apos;s society. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The staggering distribution numbers, through channels like iTunes, YouTube, or podcasting websites, indicate that technology could play a critical role in the upcoming elections. Technology could be the deciding factor in the 2008 US Presidential race, and while distribution has never before been as accessible as it is to today&apos;s politicians and political candidates, politicians have far less control over the news and media than their counterparts in previous years. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How do you get ideas for blog posts and RSS feed posts?</title>
            <description>The best blogs and feeds are those that contain unique, fresh, compelling, content. So where do these prolific posters get their ideas? I talked to a handful of bloggers to determine where their inspiration originated for their content. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not surprisingly, ideas for blog posts or RSS feed items originate or are influenced by other web content. The following are venues for finding your online muse: &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Etiquette</title>
            <description>Citizen journalists and writers have become common place on the web. Perhaps you are considering blogging, but are unsure of how to enter the world of online journaling. As the medium has grown, I thought it might be a good idea to put together some general guidelines for new bloggers and reminders to veteran bloggers about blogging practices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no Emily Post in blogging that offers etiquette advice, or a Miss Manners that details appropriate behavior. That does not mean there are not acceptable and unacceptable actions that bloggers should take. In order to efficiently communicate as a blogger on the Internet, it is critical to understand the unwritten rules of blogging etiquette.&lt;br /&gt;

It seems like all Internet businesses now have RSS feeds available; at least your competitors do. You have finally made the decision that you have to have one. Where do you start?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Tips to a Great Podcasting Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;

Podcast production takes effort, but anything worth doing is worth doing right. Use these tips to help produce a quality podcast that will be distinguished above other related podcasts... &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The RSS2HTML Pro add on script expands the functionality of RSS2HTML by allowing publishers and webmasters to dynamically create an index of feed items. The RSS2HTML Pro script dynamically generates a separate web page for each item contained in the RSS feed. The script also creates an index of feed items as a separate web page. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As with the RSS2HTML script the web pages dynamically update as the feed&apos;s item changes, meaning that the information displayed is always current. Additionally the contents of the web pages is able to be spidered by search engines. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Sound Effects; The Power of Audio</title>
            <description>Sound effects are often used to compliment and enhance artistic presentations, whether they be podcasts, videos, or other audio/visual productions. Royalty-free sound effects are typically non-exclusive and can be used by anyone who purchases them. Professional sound effects can give a podcast or production a more professional sound. However, many new producers may not realize that sound effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find on the web without properly licensing it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most podcasters and producers do not have the time or equipment to go out and record all the sound effects they may want to incorporate into their production. Podcasters are better off using royalty-free sound effects. Royalty-free sound effects are purchased, and there is no recurring fee for the use of the effect. The purchaser may use the sound effect(s) as often as required within the license terms and conditions, without paying for the use of the sound effect each time the effect is used. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Sound effects are an important part of entertainment, often comprising an integral part of vidoes, games, podcasts, movies, and animations. However, the costs and conditions associated with acquiring and using sound effects may be prohibitive for many rising creators of media. Thankfully, royalty free tracks offer an alternative to media producers on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Royalty free sound effect tracks can be used by anyone. Not only are they legal to use, but in most cases they may be edited, looped, or manipulated by overlaying additional tracks to create another sound.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Converting RSS Feeds to HTML</title>
            <description>Converting RSS to HTML&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Hallmarks of a Good Podcast</title>
            <description>There are many, many things that separate a&lt;i&gt; good&lt;/i&gt; podcast from all the rest. Here are a few to consider... &lt;br /&gt;
Recording Quality&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The quality of the recording is probably the most critical component of a podcast. A good podcast is easy to understand, and should be recorded at a volume level that makes it easy for listeners to hear all that is said.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements (tags) in any RSS feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is Podcasting?</title>
            <description>What is Podcasting&lt;br /&gt;
Podcasting is quickly becoming a buzz word among the techie crowd. So what is podcasting, anyway? Podcasting is online audio content that is delivered via an RSS feed. Many people liken podcasting to radio on demand. However, in reality, podcasting gives far more options in terms of content and programming than radio does. In addition, with Podcasting, listeners can determine the time and the place, meaning they decide what programming they want to receive and when they want to listen to it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Listeners can retain audio archives to listen to at their leisure. While blogs have turned many bloggers into journalists, podcasting has the potential to turn podcasters into radio personalities. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Podcasting Is Used</title>
            <description>Although podcasting is new, it is well on its way to becoming a mainstream communication medium. Podcasting, simply put, is audio files that are delivered via RSS. Many people believe that podcasting is solely for the distribution of music files, but really, nothing could be further from the truth. This emerging method of audio file distribution has opened an array of marketing and communication opportunities to businesses. Currently, most who are familiar with podcasting are technically savvy, but it is clear that podcasting will be more than a passing fad as many businesses are adopting podcasting and employing it in unusual yet powerful ways. Podcasting can be used for talk shows, tutorials, music demos, educational training, stories, comedy clips, debates or even foreign language tutorials.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>In addition to making your RSS feed available to your visitors for use with their RSS Feed Reader, as a webmaster you may also want to make the same feed available on your website for viewing with a regular web browser. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several ways to do this, some have advantages or disadvantages compared to others. The best solution is one where the webpage is automatically updated on-the-fly, is easily spidered by search engine robots, and easy to implement. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances. Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders that communities have become accustom to.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Deconstructing RSS</title>
            <description>Selecting and utilizing appropriate keywords is a critical step in Web design. If your Web site and meta tags do not contain related keywords, web surfers will be unable to find you through search engines, which use keywords to index sites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The formula is a little tricky — you will need to locate terms that are popular and relevant to your site. These terms may or may not be terms that you feel are relevant terms. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers of Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>SQL2RSS</title>
            <description>The sql2rss.php script allows you to easily create rss feeds from SQL databases. The script currently supports the conversion of MySQL databases to RSS feeds. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When using SQL2RSS the publisher has complete control over the content in the resulting RSS feed. Administrators and publishers control the database query which allows them the flexibility to determine what data is inserted into the RSS feeds from the database.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Really Simple Success</title>
            <description>In search engine optimization, great content increases the likelihood of your website receiving and maintaining a high search engine rank, which ultimately drives qualified traffic and leads to your company&apos;s website. But great content requires great distribution to really shine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Placing your content in front of the right customers at the right time is critical, especially when your customers and prospects have so many choices online for learning about the exact same products and services you sell. While there are many ways to drive traffic to your website, one of the more successful methods--syndication--also happens to be one of the most cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Syndication is conceptually simple. It allows publishers to distribute content that can be displayed in another location or context. Using RSS, publishers are able to easily create and disseminate content feeds that include news headlines, blog summaries and related links. RSS is the defined syndication standard that has become mainstream. All types of information are now available in a syndicated format.&lt;br /&gt;

<b>Podcasts and Copyrights</b><br />
Podcasting has a very low barrier to entry; all you need is audio recording software and a means of creating an RSS feed, be it through software or manual work. As a result, just about anyone can podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can't even be heard clearly. For this reason, copyright infringement leeches, often unwittingly, into a number of podcasts. To produce a successful podcast, it is important to understand and respect Western copyright laws. To help ensure that these things are done, we have compiled some information about podcasts, music, and copyright law. <br />

<b>Why Over Sharing Might Be Hurting You</b><br />
We all know someone who divulges a little too much information on the Internet. Whether it's the friend who Instagrams every meal or the relative who constantly posts updates on how Fido's doing, this phenomenon seems well on its way to pervading all the social media we use. Maybe you have even caught yourself posting a bit too much. While something that everyone seems to be doing may appear harmless enough, oversharing can have some negative consequences of which all social media users should take note. <br />

<b>Crowdsourcing and Social Media: Their Real Impact </b><br />
It seems that our society is growing ever more dependent on social media; more and more people are joining social networking giants such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and more such websites and applications are springing up to meet the rising demand for them. As society and culture continue this turn towards technology, so do the operations of society, especially through crowdsourcing. <br />

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Influence of Technology on Politics</title>
            <description>The staggering distribution numbers, through channels like iTunes, YouTube, or podcasting websites, indicate that technology could play a critical role in the upcoming elections.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can, and will, the next generation of politicians exploit the communication mediums available to them? Will the new communication mediums have the power to influence public opinion? Will politicians be the victims of technology, or will they use it to their benefit? Will one party benefit from the use of the technology more than another? All reasonable questions, considering the role technology plays in todays society. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Questioning Online Credibility</title>
            <description>Credibility online is becoming more and more of an issue. Anyone can have a blog or post to a forum and anyone can edit wiki entries. Web surfers are beginning to comprehend that just because it is in print does not necessarily mean that it is true. In fact, in today&apos;s online world, the collective truth might be the closest thing we can get to the real truth. Peer policing and social bookmarking have become common in the online world. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What RSS is Not...</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[It is difficult to have a conversation about technology these days that does not involve RSS. In the age of the Internet, communication is expected to be instantaneous. RSS offers instant real-time distribution in an on demand world. <br />
<br />
<b>What is RSS? </b><br />
RSS is a standard format for syndicating information or content over the Internet. Once a visitor subscribes to an RSS feed, they receive the new information each time the feed is updated. <br />
<br />
<b>RSS Does Not Equal Email</b><br />
RSS is not email, nor is it designed to be a replacement for email. RSS is a supplemental communication channel that can be used to deliver content.<br />

            <description>Podcasting Tips &lt;br /&gt;
As podcasts increase in popularity, listeners have more choices. So while you might be ahead of the competition, you should still be thinking about ways that you can make your podcast unique and stand out from similarly themed podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Plan Accordingly. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When making the decision and commitment to podcast, it is important to think beyond the moment. Before starting, think about the time the podcast production will take. How will podcasting fit into a current schedule? How frequently will you podcast? &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Purpose: The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements (tags) in any RSS feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasts and Copyrights</title>
            <description>Podcasting has a very low barrier to entry; all you need is audio recording software and a means of creating an RSS feed, be it through software or manual work. As a result, just about anyone can podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can not even be heard clearly.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Consumer education is something many small software companies tend to overlook. While the benefits of consumer education may not always be obvious, the fact of the matter is that educated customers are good customers, and happier customers. A customer who does not understand an application&apos;s capabilities or features is more likely to experience frustration with it, making them less satisfied with your product and also potentially draining your support time. Therefore, we&apos;ve created a brief guide to consumer education to help you enhance your business.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Most podcasters and producers do not have the time or equipment to go out and record all the sound effects they may want to incorporate into their production. Podcasters are better off using royalty-free sound effects. Royalty-free sound effects are purchased, and there is no recurring fee for the use of the effect. The purchaser may use the sound effect(s) as often as required within the license terms and conditions, without paying for the use of the sound effect each time the effect is used. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Etiquette</title>
            <description>Citizen journalists and writers have become common place on the web. Perhaps you are considering blogging, but are unsure of how to enter the world of online journaling. As the medium has grown, I thought it might be a good idea to put together some general guidelines for new bloggers and reminders to veteran bloggers about blogging practices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no Emily Post in blogging that offers etiquette advice, or a Miss Manners that details appropriate behavior. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Create a Personal Namespace</title>
            <description>The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements tags in any RSS feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>There are a variety of things you can do to promote your podcast and increase its popularity... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Crowd Sourcing and Social Media</title>
            <description>It seems that our society is growing ever more dependent on social media; more and more people are joining social networking giants such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and more such websites and applications are springing up to meet the rising demand for them. As society and culture continue this turn towards technology, so do the operations of society, especially through crowdsourcing. A powerful tool, crowdsourcing does much good, but has also caused a number of problems. In such a situation, one must ask: do the benefits of crowdsourcing really outweigh the risks.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS News You Choose</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<b>Why is RSS So Magical?</b><br />
The answer is simple: RSS is news you choose. <br />
<br />
<b>How Does it Work?</b><br />
Publishers and webmasters provide content and news in an RSS feed. Users view the content of interest in an RSS reader or news aggregator. The aggregator or reader contains the collection of feeds that are of interest to the user. As the RSS feed is updated the content in the reader or aggregator updates with the new information. At any point, users can remove a feed from their aggregator or reader and no longer receive information from that source. Ultimately, the user is choosing the news and content they wish to view.<br />

<b>How to Protect Digital Content </b><br />

<b>Working From Home </b><br />
Developments in technology have made it possible, if not easy, for small businesses and employees to telecommute. Working from home can be quite a different experience from an office job, and many find it a preferable one. However, those who work from home may also face some of the intrinsic downsides of telecommuting. To sort out the good and the bad of telecommuting, we have compiled a list of the major pros and cons that those who work from home might experience.<br />

<b>Develop Content Worth Linking To </b><br />
All webmasters have heard the adage, <i>content is king</i>. However, the struggle to discern what types of content to develop is one that webmasters have yet to conquer. If you are familiar with this dilemma, you should know that Google's latest algorithm changes cause Google to assess how visitors interact with a website. This data from a visitor's experience is now used in organic search ranking. Therefore, you must create content that visitors will not only click on, but that they will spend time reading and even return to. For content development success, develop content not only worth linking to, but worth spending time on! <br />

            <title>How Podcasting is Used</title>
            <description>Although podcasting is new, it is well on its way to becoming a mainstream communication medium. Podcasting, simply put, is audio files that are delivered via RSS. Many people believe that podcasting is solely for the distribution of music files, but really, nothing could be further from the truth. This emerging method of audio file distribution has opened an array of marketing and communication opportunities to businesses. Currently, most who are familiar with podcasting are technically savvy, but it is clear that podcasting will be more than a passing fad as many businesses are adopting podcasting and employing it in unusual yet powerful ways. Podcasting can be used for talk shows, tutorials, music demos, educational training, stories, comedy clips, debates or even foreign language tutorials. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Great Podcasting Sounds</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast and a not-so-good podcast.

            <title>Customer Testimonials and Profiles</title>
            <description>Testimonials are essentially 3rd-party endorsements for a product or service. Potential customers will often look for testimonials when faced with a purchasing decision. Customer testimonials can increase sales closing rates by removing uncertainty and instilling confidence in the customer.

            <title>Dangers in Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedforall.com/sql2rss.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;SQL2RSS&lt;/a&gt; script allows you to easily create rss feeds from SQL databases. The script currently supports the conversion of MySQL databases to RSS feeds. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When using SQL2RSS the publisher has complete control over the content in the resulting RSS feed. Administrators and publishers control the database query which allows them the flexibility to determine what data is inserted into the RSS feeds from the database.</description>

            <title>Podcast Sermons</title>
            <description>The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances. Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders that communities have become accustom to. Using technology as a communication medium has not been lost on spiritual leaders and many have embraced the Internet as a medium to spread their faith. It is rare to find a house of worship that does not have a website or Internet presense. Expanding upon this theme, parishes looked to podcasting to further expanded the reach of their spiritual counselors and ministers. Many preachers record homilies, hymns, services, sermons or gospel teachings, for parishioners and interested listeners.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Personal RSS Feed Namespaces</title>
            <description>The RSS specification allows you to create and use your own custom elements tags in any RSS feed, by declaring your own namespace. Doing this is 100% in line with the RSS specification and the feed will validate. However, you should have a specific and well-planned reason to do so. No RSS readers, or other RSS processing applications will be able to use your custom info for any purpose. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcast Audio Recording Tips</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Before you begin podcasting develop a plan and a format for your show. Determine the focus of your podcast and what types of guests you would like to interview. Time spent planning your show will contribute to its success.<br />
<b></b><br />
<b>Location, Location, Location</b><br />
When you are producing a podcast on a regular basis it is important that you select an appropriate location for the recording to take place. The location should be free of external distractions and relatively quiet. It is easiest if you use the same location each time, that way the equipment can remain in place and will not require moving or setup each time you produce a show.<br />

Use software to edit the audio file and filter background noise. Listeners will not tolerate poor audio quality. With the wide range of relatively inexpensive software and hardware available there is no reason you can not provide good quality audio podcast. <br />

            <title>The Dangers of Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives.&lt;br /&gt;

<b>Benefits - Pros Of Using RSS</b><br />
The benefits for a webmaster who opts to implement RSS feeds on their website are numerous: <br />
<br />

RSS feeds save time. RSS subscribers can quickly scan RSS feeds, without having to visit each and every website. Subscribers can then click on any items they are interested in, to get additional information.<br />

            <description>RSS offers webmasters a unique opportunity to display fresh content on websites. While publishing an RSS feed is a great way to generate site interest and increase communication, syndicating and displaying feeds from related relevant sources can also generate interest, increase traffic and improve search engine ranking.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Publicize Your RSS Feed</title>
            <description>There is little argument from webmasters and publishers that RSS brings in traffic. So once you&apos;ve made the leap and created a feed, how do you tell your visitors about the feed?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt; 1. Submit Your RSS Feed to RSS Directories. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This will not only increase the number of sites linking to your website and increasing your link popularity, it will also increase the RSS feeds profile. A number of RSS search engines and RSS directories exist that allow you to freely submit RSS feeds. Feeds are generally categorized and grouped together by subject. Web surfers looking for RSS feeds about a specific subject will often search the RSS directories, to locate a feed that matches their specific criteria. Topic specific RSS feed and podcasting directories are also emerging. Choose a web feed&apos;s category carefully and only submit relevant feeds to topic specific directories.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Need a Domain Name?</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<b>How To Choose A Domain Name - Part 1</b><br />
<br />
So, you have an idea or a product.... now you need a domain name for a website. How do you choose a great domain name? Here are a few ideas... <br />
<br />
<b>Brainstorm </b><br />
Create a list of words or phrases that relate to the product, service, information, or brand that will be promoted on the website.<br />
<br />
<b>Experiment </b><br />
Experiment with variations of the words in the above list. Change the order of words in phrases to create unique combinations for possible domain names. <br />

<br />
<b>How To Choose A Domain Name - Part 2</b><br />
<br />
Here are some other things to pay attention to when selecting domain names... <br />
<b></b><br />
<b>1. Domain Extensions</b><br />
Many webmasters wrestle not only with choosing the best domain name, but also with the decision of what domain extensions to select for their website. The following is a general guide to what the most popular domain extensions represent...<br />
<br />
.com - commercial (by far, the most popular domain extension)<br />
.net - network host (often used by hosting companies)<br />
.edu - educational institution<br />
.org - organization<br />
.info - informational sites<br />
<br />
If your primary focus is in a local market, you may find value in a local domain as well.<br />

<b>Tips to Get Things Accomplished </b><br />
All of us start the day with every intention of completing a variety of tasks, but unfortunately many of us become distracted as the day moves on.

As well intentioned as you may be, it seems to become a routine, and one that far too many of us fall into. <br />

            <title>Website Spidering</title>
            <description>Website Spidering refers to the automated process of indexing a web site by a search engine. An automated program, known as a web crawler or spider, will go through a website following the links on each page, and will gather pertinent information from each page until it has properly indexed the entire website.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>2011 Reflections, 2012 Predictions</title>
            <description>No country suffered more than Japan in 2011. Japan was rocked by an 8.9 earthquake, then a tsunami that was created from the quake hit the small island. The tsunami caused significant damage to one of Japans power plants making it impossible to properly cool or shutdown the nuclear reactor. The inability to cool the nuclear plant resulted in a nuclear melt down, and the escape of radiation. When the trifecta hit, the Japanese people earned the world&apos;s respect, they managed the tragedy with stoicism and grace. The consequences of this horrible tragedy, and implications of the radiation leaks, into the sea and atmosphere are still unknown. Japan will bear the scars from 2011, for generations to come.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<b>What is Hot and What is Not in Technology for 2012</b><br />
<br />
<b>1. Mushroom Cloud</b><br />
<br />
The virtual cloud is now a mushroom cloud. More and more applications and data is available virtually. Customers are no longer tied to their desktops, data is accessible in the cloud. As long as you have an Internet connection, you have access, regardless of your hardware.<br />
<b></b><br />
<b>2. Smart Mobility</b><br />
<br />
Mobile phones have become smart devices, they are more than just phones and alarm clocks. By the end of 2012, it will be hard to find a phone that does not run games, support Internet connections and have built in web browser.<br />
<b></b><br />
<b>3. Multi-Function Devices</b><br />
<br />
I suspect that devices will begin merging, there is no longer a need for so many gadgets. The functionality of the devices from smart phones, kindles, ipads and computers are redundant and there is likely to be device consolidation as the overlap in functionality increases. <br />

            <title>Podcasting Sermons</title>
            <description>The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances. Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Audio File Optimization Tips</title>
            <description>Optimize your audio files to increase their popularity, just as you would optimize a website. Audio search engines are becoming more advanced as audio files become more commonplace on the Internet. Here are some tips to optimize your audio offerings...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Optimize Landing Page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Create a landing page for the audio files. The landing page should explain the audio content and encourage subscriptions. Outline the steps the visitor should take in order to subscribe or listen to the audio file. Make an effort to interact with the visitor on the landing page, and make it as easy as possible for them to subscribe or listen to your podcast. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Blog Tips for SEO</title>
            <description>Blogs are the current rage, and many webmasters have blogs but fail to use their blog to its full potential. Blogs provide a steady stream of fresh content, and if this content is written and managed properly, blogs have the ability to increase a website&apos;s ranking in the search engines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Host Your Own Blog&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In order to prosper from a blog, be sure to host it on your own domain. Hosting the blog on your own server will maximize the links to your website. Link popularity is one of the factors search engines use to rank websites. Resist the urge to use free hosting services, do not give away your link popularity!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Power of Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Sound effects are often used to compliment and enhance artistic presentations, whether they be podcasts, videos, or other audio/visual productions. Royalty-free sound effects are typically non-exclusive and can be used by anyone who purchases them. Professional sound effects can give a podcast or production a more professional sound. However, many new producers may not realize that sound effects have copyrights, and in many cases it is illegal to use a sound effect that you happen to find on the web without properly licensing it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Dangers of Blogging</title>
            <description>I have heard many a blogger say that blogging fills a need. While blogging provides a humanizing effect on news and journaling, it also opens a window into personal lives. The details shared in blogs were once only available to a select group of friends, and while blogging has become common place, it has risks that should not be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberstalking is a new phenomenon that allows anonymous online stalkers to prowl for victims. Online bloggers traditionally provide personal details about their lives. As a result, many women that blog are becoming victims. Most people are concerned about children on the Internet and set up rigorous posting guidelines for children, adolescents, and teenagers, but few adults heed the warnings and often do not consider that they too can be targeted. &lt;br /&gt;

The following is a set of Twitter etiquette guidelines, but can also be applied to other social networks... &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Podcast Tips to a Great Sound</title>
            <description>What defines a good podcast? Make no mistake -- there is a difference between a good podcast and a not-so-good podcast. A high-caliber podcast is much more than just decent content. The sound quality, and the way a podcast is recorded, will impact the value of the podcast as well. Podcast structure and pre-planning are also important; do not skimp on the production, as it too can make or break a podcast. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Realtors Use RSS to Sell Homes</title>
            <description>Daily more and more realtors are turning to RSS as a tool to market homes for sale. The growing RSS phenomenon in the realty market makes perfect sense. Unlike email RSS feeds have a 100% delivery rate. In addition the costs involved in creating and managing an RSS feed are insignificant when compared to the print advertising Realtors spend on each week. Imagine the amount spent each week to promote various properties in circulars and weekly newspapers, compared to the costs associated with updating and managing an RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>
                <![CDATA[<b>1.) Title</b> - The title should really be no longer than 10-12 words. Use the title as a headline to attract interest.<br />
<br />
<b>2.) Description</b> - Descriptions are generally summaries, provide additional information to entice the reader to click through for the full information if it is a topic that is of interest to them. Provide enough teaser copy that they can easily discern if its something that is important to them. <br />

            <title>RSS Extensions</title>
            <description>One of the benefits to the RSS 2.0 specification is it&apos;s expandability. RSS 2.0 extensions are often called namespaces. Namespaces allow for users or companies to create new tags or elements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The RSS 2.0 specification goes into detail about how namespaces can be documented to prevent confusion and overlap. The extendibility of the specifications allow a number of industries to use the standard and enhance it, with their specific needs without causing undue confusion or problems, with the original specification. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Technology Has Spawned Industries</title>
            <description>The technical search giant, Google, alone is the inspiration and sole cause behind the creation of thousands of new businesses. There are now companies dedicated solely to Pay-Per-Click campaign management. Thousands of individuals and companies now make money through search engine optimization and outsourcing their services to improve website rankings, specifically to see that a website ranks well in Googles organic search results. There are now software applications that can determine what keywords to use in optimizing a website for search engine rankings, and other software programs that assess and evaluate website traffic and popularity. These products and businesses were all brought to fruition as a result of Googles Internet search domination and technical stature.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>ABCs of RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Implementing RSS (Really Simple Syndication) can be aided by an understanding of the terms relating to RSS. Learn the ABCs of RSS....<br />
<br />
<b>A - AutoDiscovery</b><br />
<br />
Auto Discovery is code that is inserted into the header of an HTML web page, which then indicates to readers that an RSS feed is available for the content.<br />
<br />
<b>B - Blogs</b><br />
<br />
Blogs are web logs that are updated regularly, usually on a daily basis. Blogs generally contain information related to a specific topic. In some cases, blogs are used as daily diaries about people's personal lives, political views, or even as social commentaries. The truth of the matter is that blogs can be shaped into whatever the author wants them to be. While initially thought of as diaries or online journals, blogs have evolved into the latest fresh web content. <br />

As the content of an RSS feed changes, the RSS reader or aggregator will update itself automatically and display the new RSS feed items. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Emotion of Color in Web Design</title>
            <description>Color psychology is a phrase used to describe the effect that &lt;i&gt;color &lt;/i&gt;has on human behavior. The psychology of color is certainly not a new concept. In fact, it has been around for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Colors tend to carry non-verbal and subliminal messages, and the color spectrum evokes different emotions and physiological responses in people. The reactions people have to specific colors may be influenced by many factors, including their culture, location, gender, or even their age. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Link Gold</title>
            <description>Links are the threads that bind the web together. The Internet &lt;i&gt;web&lt;/i&gt; is not so different from an actual spider web. Each page on the Internet is connected by an intricate system of links which connect websites to other websites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order for a website to perform well in search engine rankings, it must have connections to other websites through links. These connections or links not only help search engines locate new content as it becomes available, but they also weave together networks of websites that are all related. The number and strength of connections that a website has will help determine the importance of that website. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS2HTML.com is Shut Down</title>
            <description>Unfortunately due to a handful of individuals using the RSS2HTML.com service and distributing malware in their feeds, the site was flagged by Google. As a result we had to discontinue the free rss2html.com service. We highly recommend you download the RSS2HTML script and run it locally so that the interruption will not effect your feeds from displaying. The free RSS2HTML script can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedforall.com/free-php-script.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; &gt;http://www.feedforall.com/free-php-script.htm&lt;/a&gt;</description>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[Many webmasters repeat the mistakes made by their predecessors. Take a look at these Top 10 most common web design sins. Have you fallen victim to any of these?<br />
<br />
<b>Sin #1 - Using Techie-Speak</b><br />
<br />
Many websites fail to communicate in terms that website visitors can understand. Set the technical jargon aside, and use simple language and words that will be easy for your audience to understand. Web copy should be written in simple terms. Also, keep in mind that the Internet audience is global, and using language that is more common and easy to comprehend will often expand your reach, even to include non-native speakers.<br />
<br />
<b>Sin #2 - Poor Navigation</b><br />
<br />
Many webmasters fail to provide visitors clear and consistent navigation. Visitors will quickly become frustrated if they cannot easily find the information they are looking for.<br />
